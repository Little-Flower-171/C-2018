### Case 1

#### Input

```
Remember me,
Though I have to say goodbye.
Remember me,
Don't let it make you cry.
For even if I'm far away,
I hold you in my heart.
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart.
Remember me,
Though I have to travel far.
Remember me,
Each time you hear a sad guitar.
And know that I'm with you,
The only way that I can be,
Until you're arms again.
Remember me.
```
